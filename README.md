# Fraze
How many times you wanted to generate a random string, but wanted it to be more random, than pressing "random" keys?

Probably never. Therefore, I present you a tool you never needed!

## Usage
`python fraze.py [-l] [-u] [-d] [-p] [-c] <length>`

`-l` - Use lowercase ASCII letters

`-u` - Use uppercase ASCII letters

`-d` - Use digits

`-p` - Use punctuation

`-c` - Copy generated string (requires pyperclip)

`length` - Length of generated string

`-h` - In case you forget how to use this simple script
